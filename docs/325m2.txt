[note]: this document is something I wrote I toyed with in ~2006, and then finally
wrote fully in ~2011. It's funny because these ideas became carML to a large extent,
but also the Scala community added Scala-Native with similar features.

----------------

325 m^2 is 1/4 a Scala (Cretian unit of measure)

support:

object, class, if/else, when, not, and, or, def, val, for, match, case,
int, float, double, List, Array, String, Char

compile to:
    - C: native, minimal run time, should be self-hosting
        + should generate legible code, even at expense of some optimizations
    - JS: support both legible & illegible outputs (based on aggression of optimization),
        with JS support for Canvas, &c.

Should support (G)ADTs, Dependent Types

Examples of what I'm thinking of:

def main(args: Array[String]) = println("Hello, world");


def main(args: Array[String]) {
    for (val a <- args) {
        println("a: " + a);
    }
}

def main(args: Array[String])  = for (val a <- args) { println(a); }

def foo(x) = x + x; /* Type of Number? */

def main(args: Array[String]) {
    for (val a <- args) {
        println(foo(Number.parseNumber(a)));
    }
}


class AddressBook {
    class Person {
        val name : String;
        val surname : String;
    }
}

def sum(i: Int*) {
    if(i.length >= 1) {
        i(0) + /* ... */
    } else {
        0
    }
}
